## ðŸ§© SFP

This schema extension gives you all the models you need to document Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP).

You can either plug it into an interface or attach it to a location (e.g. it's a spare SFP stored in a rack).

Improvements:

- As of now there is no verification with type / form factor / protocol / distance ...
- You could plug any SFP into any equipment interface (e.g. a virtual interface ...)
- You could link a SFP to an interface AND a location ...
- Maybe add a link toward manufacturer ...
